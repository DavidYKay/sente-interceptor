## Usage

Clone, and cd into the `rente` folder.

```
lein figwheel
```

Wait for figwheel to finish and notify browser of changed files! Then in another terminal tab:

```
lein run
```

point browser to:
http://localhost:8080

Open up your browser console, which will log the data returned from the server when you click either of the 2 buttons for socket with/without callback (pull/push).

## Deploy to Heroku

To make Rente run on Heroku, you need to let Leiningen on Heroku use the "package" build task.

To make this work you need to point Heroku to this build pack:
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure

To do this, and point Leiningen on Heroku to the "package" target, add the following two config variables to Heroku by running this command:

```
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure LEIN_BUILD_TASK=package
```

## Deploy
